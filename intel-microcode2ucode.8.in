.SH NAME
intel\-microcode2ucode \- convert Intel microcode.dat file into ucode files
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.SY intel\-microcode2ucode
.RI [ MICROCODE_FILE ]
.YS
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B intel\-microcode2ucode
parses Intel microcode combined text data file (which usually has name
.BR microcode.dat )
and splits it into individual binary microcode files that can be loaded by the
Linux kernel.
.LP
Generated microcode files are placed into
.B intel-ucode
directory, which is created in the current working directory, and have file name
format of
.IR FF - MM - SS ,
where
.I FF
is the CPU family number,
.I MM
is the model number, and
.I SS
is stepping.
All three values are zero-filled to two digits and are hexadecimal
(letters are in the lower case).
.LP
This tool is mostly of historic interest, as Intel ships separate microcode
files now.
